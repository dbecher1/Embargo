# Embargo

A C++ build tool for the modern world.

## Motivation

Inspired by Rust's Cargo in more than just name, the vision for Embargo is to create a build system that brings accessibility to the novice programmer, while not sacrificing power, performance and customizability for the power user.

This tool is just barely in its infancy, so almost if not all features mentioned are likely to be in progress, if not entirely yet unimplemented. The purpose for this README is, as of now, mostly to cast vision for how exciting Embargo can and should be.

## Requirements

 - A C++ compiler, defaulting to `g++`
 - `git` for version control

## Installation

TODO; there will eventually be an installation script that will set up enviornment variables and etc
